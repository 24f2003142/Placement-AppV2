### Placyx – Placement Management Portal

Placyx is a web-based placement management system designed to streamline the campus recruitment process by connecting students, companies, and administrators on a single platform.

The application automates the placement workflow from company registration and job posting to student applications, candidate selection, and placement tracking.

The system is implemented using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite, with a responsive interface built using Bootstrap and Jinja2 templates.

# Database Overview

The system database contains the following main tables:

- **Users** – Stores authentication credentials and roles  
- **Students** – Contains academic and personal details of students  
- **Companies** – Stores company information and approval status  
- **JobPosts** – Represents placement drives created by companies  
- **Applications** – Tracks student applications and selection status

# Installation and Setup

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/24f2003142/Placement-App.git
cd Placement-App/placyx
./local.ps1
```

- These commands will create the virtual environment, install dependencies, create the database, and launch the web application.
- Redis is required for Celery background jobs.
- `local.ps1` will try to install Redis automatically if Scoop, Chocolatey, or winget is available.
- If installation is not possible, `local.ps1` will still fall back to starting Redis via Docker or WSL when available.
---

## Default Admin Account

When the database initializes, a default admin account is automatically created.

# Email
```bash
admin@placyx.com
```
# Password
```bash
admin123
```
---
## File Uploads

Uploaded files are stored in:
```bash
static/uploads/
```
These include:
- Student profile photos
- Student resumes
- Company logos

---

## Security Features

- Password hashing using Werkzeug
- Role-based authorization
- Login session protection using Flask-Login
- Restricted access to protected routes
- Prevention of duplicate job applications

---
## Future Improvements
Potential enhancements include:
- Resume parsing and candidate ranking
- Email notifications for job updates
- Multi-college deployment support
- AI-based candidate-job matching
- Cloud deployment and containerization
